Description: Assists in the whole process of designing and evaluating Randomized Control Trials.
    Robust treatment assignment by strata/blocks, that handles misfits; 
    Power calculations of the minimum detectable treatment effect or minimum populations;
    Balance tables of T-test of covariates; 
    Balance Regression: (treatment ~ all x variables) with F-test of null model; 
    Impact_evaluation: Impact evaluation regressions. This function
    gives you the option to include control_vars, fixed effect variables,
    cluster variables (for robust SE), multiple endogenous variables and
    multiple heterogeneous variables (to test treatment effect heterogeneity)
    summary_statistics: Function that creates a summary statistics table with statistics 
    rank observations in n groups: Creates a factor variable with n groups. Each group has 
    a min and max label attach to each category.
